ðŸš€ Your App: IG Media Scraper + Transcriber
You're building a full-scale content intelligence platform centered on Instagram media scraping and transcription â€” especially useful for creators, marketers, and content strategists.

ðŸ”§ Key Features (Built or Planned):
1. Instagram Media Analyzer
Scrapes top-performing media (reels, posts) in a selected niche using instaloader.

Extracts metadata (likes, captions, hashtags, engagement).

Helps users discover content trends.

2. Reel Transcription Engine (Current focus)
Accepts a Reel URL from Instagram.

Downloads the video using instaloader.

Converts it to audio using moviepy.

Transcribes the audio to text using OpenAI Whisper (runs locally, no API costs).

Returns full transcript + speaker labeling (if used).

Useful for:

Content repurposing

Caption generation

SEO optimization

Market research

3. Backend Architecture
Uses FastAPI or Flask to expose endpoints.

Runs heavy jobs in background using Celery + Redis.

Packaged and deployed with Docker for reliability.

May use file cleanup routines to handle storage over time.

Can be hosted on cloud platforms (like Fly.io, Railway, etc.) â€” potentially using GitHub Student Pack credits.

4. Scalable & Free Infrastructure
Uses free tools only:

instaloader (no API key)

moviepy (FFmpeg backend)

openai/whisper (self-hosted model)

Avoids paid APIs (like AssemblyAI or Meta Graph API) for full control.

Designed to scale to many transcription requests without blocking.

ðŸ§  Ultimate Goal
Build a creator tool that pulls top IG content in a niche, transcribes it, and helps users generate new content ideas, scripts, or captions â€” automatically and at scale.
